## 2026-10-15 — the web UI's memory panel is scoped per session

Every run re-seeds its trunk memory slots at `scope_id 0`, so the UI's tracked
memory — keyed by `(scope_id, name)` in one global map — was last-write-wins
across *all* live conversations. With a web session and a followed Telegram
session both running (2026-10-14), the "trunk" panel showed the Telegram
call-list's `priorities` beside the web enrich run's `state`: a chimera of two
conversations, because both wrote the same slot keys.

`webMemoryValues`/`webMemoryPaths` now nest under the conversation key,
`trackMemoryWrite` takes the key, `/api/tree/memory` serves the session in view
(`?session=` overrides it), and the SSE push names its session so the client
drops a stray one. Switching sessions no longer wipes the panel — each session
keeps its own values — a deleted session drops its slots, and the maps are
bounded at 32 conversations.

## 2026-10-15 — tool-result refs pass through the logger wrapper

`ref://<seq>` handles (grandma-kat's new way of handing an oversized tool
result to another tree without it fitting the model's context) need the run's
logger to be readable: the engine checks `logger.readRow` and resolves refs
with it. BOB's `wrapLogger` telemetry wrapper delegated checkpoints and events
but not `readRow`, so with `onEvent` active (the web UI live view) refs would
never mint and every large result stayed a dead-end "narrow the query" note.
The wrapper now forwards `readRow` like the other read methods.
