## 2026-10-15 — tool-result refs pass through the logger wrapper

`ref://<seq>` handles (grandma-kat's new way of handing an oversized tool
result to another tree without it fitting the model's context) need the run's
logger to be readable: the engine checks `logger.readRow` and resolves refs
with it. BOB's `wrapLogger` telemetry wrapper delegated checkpoints and events
but not `readRow`, so with `onEvent` active (the web UI live view) refs would
never mint and every large result stayed a dead-end "narrow the query" note.
The wrapper now forwards `readRow` like the other read methods.
