# web/ — browser target

A second target for grandpa-bob that runs **entirely in a browser tab**: no
server, sandboxed virtual filesystem (OPFS), WASM SQLite, workspace persisted
in browser storage.

> **Additive.** The Node target (`src/`, `npm start`) is unchanged and keeps
> Telegram, the real shell, native SQLite/DuckDB, the git CLI, `opencode`, and
> the HTTP admin server. This directory only *adds* a browser build.

See the design plan: `~/.opencode/plan/bob-in-browser.md`.

| Git auto-commit (`isomorphic-git` over OPFS) | done — **verified in real Chromium** (`git: auto-commit 5be3f65`) |
| Multi-file patterns (relative imports + named exports + node shims) | done — **verified in real Chromium** (`read/the notes file`) |
| Real `trunk` (scratch builder, app `src/*`, `appTreeNames()` scan) | not yet |

## `node:*` shims

Existing NodeNext shared modules bundle unchanged via Vite aliases:

| Import | Browser target |
|---|---|
| `node:fs` / `node:fs/promises` | OPFS (`corefs.ts`) |
| `node:path` | shared pure POSIX shim |
| `node:crypto` | shared pure SHA-256 + WebCrypto |
| `node:os`, `node:util`, `node:url` | small shims |
| `node:sqlite` | throwing stub (milestone 2) |
| `node:child_process` | throwing stub (milestone 5) |

The demo (`src/main.ts`) runs the real `listTreeSources`, `snapshotTree`, and
`promoteTree` over OPFS, proving the alias approach.

## Run

```sh
cd web
npm install
npm run make-seed /path/to/grandma-workspace   # pack workspace -> public/seed
npm run mock-llm   # terminal 1 (LLM demo)
npm run dev        # terminal 2 -> http://localhost:5173
npm run smoke      # headless end-to-end check
```

`npm run make-seed` turns a real grandpa-bob workspace (default
`$WORKSPACE_DIR` or `../../workspace`) into `web/public/seed/workspace.json`.
On first load the app imports it into OPFS (`?reseed=1` forces a re-import);
after that the browser workspace persists on its own.

### Clone from a git remote instead

Browsers cannot use `git://` (no raw TCP), so serve a repo over CORS-enabled
HTTP. `npm run git-server` fronts `git http-backend`:

```sh
npm run git-server /home/love        # -> http://127.0.0.1:8790/grandma-workspace.git
```

Then point the app at it (persisted in localStorage) or per load:

```
http://localhost:5173/?remote=http://127.0.0.1:8790/grandma-workspace.git
http://localhost:5173/?remote=...&reclone=1   # clear OPFS and clone fresh
```

The app clones into `/workspace` when it has no `.git`. To also **push** back
(copy browser → desktop), enable receive-pack on the bare repo:
`git -C <repo>.git config http.receivepack true` (loopback only; add auth before
exposing it).

`npm run smoke` needs a Chromium/Chrome binary (override with `CHROME_BIN`) and
a running dev server. It exercises OPFS writes/rename, `tree-versions`
snapshot/promote, `grandma-kat knit()`, WASM SQLite persistence, and a real LLM
round-trip.

The LLM smoke also needs the mock endpoint: `npm run mock-llm` (port 8787) in a
second terminal.

## Architecture

```
                     shared core (src/)
        (agent loop, tool registry, tree logic, prompts)
                    /                    \
        Node target                    browser target (web/)
   src/index.ts (unchanged)         web/src/main.ts (+ Worker, later)
   node:fs / node:sqlite            OPFS / sqlite-wasm
   child_process / git CLI          virtual coreutils / isomorphic-git
   HTTP + SSE                       MessagePort (milestone 3)
   grammy (Telegram)                (none)
```

Shared code depends on the interfaces in `src/platform/types.ts`; each target
injects its adapter. The pure modules (`paths`, `sha256`) contain no Node
builtins, so they run in both.

## Why a pure SHA-256

grandma-kat's `definitionId` calls `createHash("sha256")` **synchronously** from
inside `knit()`, but WebCrypto's `crypto.subtle.digest` is async. The shared
`src/platform/sha256.ts` gives the browser a synchronous hash; the Node adapter
keeps using `node:crypto`. Both are checked against `node:crypto` vectors.
